Verbastelt
==========

You like **hot glue**, **gaffer tape** or _realy dirty_ hacks?
You use them extensively in your projects ... and are proud of it?
Then this sticker is for you to put on your builds/"_repairs_".

And your thing is then certified and got 5 out of 5 TAPES!

Don't understand german? [Then this may appeal to you](../held_together/).

#### Print details

These stickers have the format `72mm * 35mm`, in CMYK colors.
Both versions have a `3mm` bleed on each side ("should be cut off").

The uv varnish ("uvlack") version contains a 5th pseudo-color named "lack",
the pink area should be shiny while the rest is dull
(behind the pink it's still blue).


#### Wtf?

If you don't know how to druckerei,
ask somebody more competent
and stay the fuck away from this shit.
