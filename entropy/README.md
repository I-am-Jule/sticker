Entropy
=======

You! ... yes, **YOU!** What have you done today to save the universe from its
inevitable fate? Did you reduce your entropy emissions? Every use of any device
_may_ increase total entropy in the universe and there is **no way to reverse it**.
You didn't know that? Shame on you, but there is hope! (and a sticker)
If you want future generations to live in an universe that is not total chaos,
reduce your entropy emissions, and warn others with this sticker. Put them
on any device pulluting our beloved universe with deadly entropy: 
[Because it helps!](../sicher)
